# Unity ironSource Adapter

# Unity ironSource Adapter + Sample App

The Kidoz Unity ironSource Adapter SDK is built and tested with ironSource mediation v7.1.13.<BR>
You should only use this version or above as it is the first stable custom mediation release. <BR>

This adapter offers support for the following ad types:

+ ironSource Interstitial Mediation 
  + ironSource Rewarded Video Mediation for ##Android##
  
Until ironSource mediation SDK supports Banner mediation for custom networks and Rewarded Videos mediation on the iOS platform, publishers who choose to do so can use Kidoz banners and Rewarded directly from Kidoz SDK.<BR>
